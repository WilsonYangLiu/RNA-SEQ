# Cuffdiff works by modeling the variance in fragment counts across replicates as a function of the mean fragment count across replicates. 
# Strictly speaking, models a quantitity called dispersion - the variance present in a group of samples beyond what is expected from a simple 
# Poisson model of RNA_Seq. You can control how Cuffdiff constructs its model of dispersion in locus fragment counts. Each condition that 
# has replicates can receive its own model, or Cuffdiff can use a global model for all conditions. All of these policies are identical to 
# those used by DESeq (Anders and Huber, Genome Biology, 2010)

Dispersion Method 	Description
pooled 	Each replicated condition is used to build a model, then these models are averaged to provide a single global model for all conditions in the experiment. (Default)
per-condition 	Each replicated condition receives its own model. Only available when all conditions have replicates.
blind 	All samples are treated as replicates of a single global “condition” and used to build one model.
poisson 	The Poisson model is used, where the variance in fragment count is predicted to equal the mean across replicates. Not recommended.

Which method you choose largely depends on whether you expect variability in each group of samples to be similar. For example, if you are 
comparing two groups, A and B, where A has low cross-replicate variability and B has high variability, it may be best to choose per-condition. 
However, if the conditions have similar levels of variability, you might stick with the default, which sometimes provides a more robust model, 
especially in cases where each group has few replicates. Finally, if you only have a single replicate in each condition, you must use blind, 
which treats all samples in the experiment as replicates of a single condition. This method works well when you expect the samples to have 
very few differentially expressed genes. If there are many differentially expressed genes, Cuffdiff will construct an overly conservative 
model and you may not get any significant calls. In this case, you will need more replicates in your experiment.
